**About:**
Meal App is an app you can use to find new recipes, and plan your meals for the week. Once you decide what you want for the week, you now have a calendar of meals, and an automatically generated grocery list.
**technologies used:**
drag and drop, jquery, javascript, localstorage

**API Used:**
Edamam Recipe Search API
https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api

**Issues**
It was difficult to implement local storage in regards to keeping dynamically generated divs on the page. I ended up having to save each element of the div into local storage in order to regenerate them once the page was loaded
